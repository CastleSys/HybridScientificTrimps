Re-configure hybrid notation in trimps

Download Tampermonkey https://www.tampermonkey.net/ then copy and paste the javascript, activate the script and refresh, then change in-game notation to hybrid.

Thanks to Noo Noo, zid and Cyber_Cheese for getting it to function and changed from engineering to scientific.
